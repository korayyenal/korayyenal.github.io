  I'm a data science MSc student in Montr√©al, QC.
  With experience spanning data science and engineering, I have a broad set of skills that enable me to cover the entire analysis process. I'm particularly interested in productionizing ML services with a focus on experimentation, ML pipelines, and model deployment.  I'm passionate about applying machine learning techniques to new disciplines and taking a data-driven approach to decision-making. Interested in working together or having a chat? Feel free to contact me. </p>

      In a wide range of subject areas, I have analyzed structured and unstructured data to extract actionable business insights, and I built and deployed advanced statistical models. I feel comfortable on Python, R, Git, and SQL. I'm also familiar with Databricks, Spark, and AWS.

      I'm strongly convinced that machine learning models should not go to waste in Jupyter Notebooks.
      Using my MLOps skills, I've automated ML models which create real business value.

      I enjoy teaching, sharing my knowledge and discussing diverse topics.
      Thanks to my training and experience in science communication, I'm able to present complex results to a non-technical audience.
